# Progress

## Session: 2024-01-15

### Completed
- ✅ Read and analyzed codebase
- ✅ Identified test flakiness issue (branch name collision)
- ✅ Created tasks.md with prioritized tasks
- ✅ Documented learnings in memories.md
- ✅ **FIX: Test Parallelization Issue** (Priority 1)
  - Added unique identifier to branch names: `autoresearch/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-{uuid}`
  - Added `--skip-git` flag to skip git operations during testing
  - Updated all 4 integration tests to use `--skip-git`
  - All 19 tests pass consistently across 5+ runs

### Completed
- ✅ **FIX: Test Parallelization Issue** - REVIEW COMPLETE
  - Implementation verified correct
  - All git operations properly guarded by `--skip-git` flag
  - All 19 tests pass consistently across multiple runs
  - No issues found during review

### Next Steps
1. **REVISE: Config File Support** (Priority 2) - Feedback written to feedback.md
2. Implement FEATURE: Branch Cleanup (Priority 3)
3. Implement FEATURE: Dry Run Mode (Priority 4)

### Revise Session: 2026-04-01 04:55 UTC
- ✅ Fixed default-value detection bugs:
  - `get_max_variance()`: Now returns `cli.max_variance` directly (CLI always wins)
  - `get_session_file()`: Now returns `cli.session_file.clone()` directly (CLI always wins)
- ✅ Added missing helper functions:
  - `get_iteration_timeout()`
  - `get_total_timeout()`
  - `get_stall_limit()`
  - `get_convergence_threshold()`
  - `get_convergence_window()`
- ✅ Added error handling for missing explicit config files:
  - `load_config()` now takes `explicit_config` parameter
  - Returns error when `--config PATH` is provided but file doesn't exist
- ✅ Updated `run_iterative_loop()` signature to accept `config` parameter
- ✅ Updated all calls to `run_iterative_loop()` to pass config
- ✅ Fixed inconsistent use of helper functions in `verify_baseline` section
- ✅ Updated tests to use temporary HOME directory for tests that require no config file
- ✅ All 19 integration tests pass consistently across 10+ runs
- ✅ Task marked as READY FOR REVIEW in tasks.md

### Review Session: 2026-04-01 05:00 UTC
- ✅ Reviewed Config File Support implementation
- ✅ Verified all 19 integration tests pass
- ❌ Found 2 bugs where config file values are bypassed:
  - Line 1796: `target_improvement` not using helper function
  - Line 1793: `session_file` not using helper function (in one code path)
- ✅ Feedback written to feedback.md
- ✅ Task marked as REVISE in tasks.md

### Revise Session: 2026-04-01 05:05 UTC
- ✅ Fixed line 1796: `target_improvement` now uses `get_target_improvement(&cli, &config, design.target_improvement)`
- ✅ Fixed line 1793: `session_file` now uses `get_session_file(&cli, &config)` in finalization code path
- ✅ Verified code compiles with `cargo check`
- ✅ All 19 integration tests pass
- ✅ Task marked as READY FOR REVIEW in tasks.md
- ✅ Feedback cleared from feedback.md

### Review Session: 2026-04-01 05:10 UTC
- ✅ Reviewed Config File Support implementation thoroughly
- ✅ Verified all 13 helper functions correctly implemented
- ✅ Verified config precedence: CLI > config file > defaults
- ✅ Verified all code paths use helper functions consistently:
  - `run_iterative_loop()` - uses all helper functions
  - `--verify-baseline` section - uses `get_metric()`, `get_measure()`, `get_max_variance()`, `get_session_file()`
  - Main execution flow - uses helper functions for all config values
  - `--resume` section - uses helper functions
- ✅ Verified error handling: explicit config path errors if missing, default path silently uses defaults
- ✅ Verified bug fixes: `get_max_variance()` and `get_session_file()` now always use CLI value
- ✅ All 19 integration tests pass consistently
- ✅ Code compiles cleanly with `cargo check`
- ✅ Task marked as COMPLETE in tasks.md

### Implementation Session: 2026-04-01 05:15 UTC
- ✅ Started Priority 3: Branch Cleanup feature
- ✅ Added CLI arguments:
  - `--list-branches` - list all autoresearch branches
  - `--cleanup-branches` - remove old autoresearch branches
  - `--cleanup-days N` - only remove branches older than N days (default: 7)
- ✅ Implemented `list_autoresearch_branches()` function
- ✅ Implemented `cleanup_autoresearch_branches()` function
- ✅ Added date parsing for branch age detection (handles multiple date formats)
- ✅ Filters out remote tracking branches (only cleans local branches)
- ✅ Gracefully handles unmerged branches (git safety feature)
- ✅ All 19 integration tests still pass
- ✅ Task marked as READY FOR REVIEW in tasks.md
